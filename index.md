## Welcome to duaneking.github.io

I just rediscovered this thing and hoped  to make updates as I can if mermaid is supported as that for me is the killer app.  Thing is, Mermaid does not work and I feel lied to by gh.

### Mermaid?

I just want this mermaidjs to render without me needing to edit *.md files in a special way. I just want *.md files to render mermaidJS on gh-pages just like it should on gh without having to make any modifications to the file for either. That to me is the most accessable.

```mermaid
  graph TD;
      A-->B;
      A-->C;
      B-->D;
      C-->D;
```
