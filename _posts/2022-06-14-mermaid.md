## It Works.

I got MermaidJS working a while back.  But it bugs me. <!--more-->

My only option with the default pipeline for GitHub Pages is to allow GitHub to corrupt my input data, render it slightly incorrectly, and then in your browser fix it by hand-patching the DOM via JavaScript.  That works and renders it well.

I'm just not happy with my solution because I know its sub-optimal, and it does not support accessibility in the way I really want to; I just don't know of a way to add this support if GitHub itself wont commit to providing accessability.

### Mermaid?

My original goal was to get this mermaidjs to render without me needing to edit .md files in a special way. I just wanted .md files to render mermaidJS on gh-pages just like it does on GH itself, without having to make any modifications to the file for either. That to me is the most accessible.  But GitHub doesn't seem to care about this.

I just wanted the following to render correctly on GitHub Pages with no changes to this index.md file itself. That's it. That is the use case.

```mermaid
  graph TD;
      A-->B;
      A-->C;
      B-->D;
      C-->D;
```

It does. So now what? What do I use this for?
